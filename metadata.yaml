description: "Evelina or the History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World is\
  \ a novel written by English author Fanny Burney and first published in 1778. Although\
  \ published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford\
  \ in what Burney called a \"vile poem.\"\nIn this 3-volume epistolary novel, title\
  \ character Evelina is the unacknowledged, but legitimate daughter of a dissipated\
  \ English aristocrat, thus raised in rural seclusion until her 17th year. Through\
  \ a series of humorous events that take place in London and the resort town of Hotwells,\
  \ near Bristol, Evelina learns to navigate the complex layers of 18th-century society\
  \ and earn the love of a distinguished nobleman. This sentimental novel, which has\
  \ notions of sensibility and early romanticism, satirizes the society in which it\
  \ is set and is a significant precursor to the work of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth,\
  \ whose novels explore many of the same issues.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
